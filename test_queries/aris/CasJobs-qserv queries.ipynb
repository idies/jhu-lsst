    "3. Return all detections within a rectangle specified by equatorial or galactic coordinates; index all unique sources, provide the total number of detections for each source, index detections according to time (run number). Motivation: doing light curve for a large number of sources\n",
    "4. Return all objects with difference between the brightest and faintest state (in a given band, or any band), or between one of the extreme states and the mean/median value, larger/smaller than X mag. Motivation: objects with impeccable photometry eclipsing binaries, outbursts, etc.\n",
    "5. Return all objects with rms in a given band greater/smaller than X mag. Motivation: a part of classic variability search\n",
    "6. Return all objects with chi^2 in a given band greater/smaller than Y. Motivation: a part of classic variability search\n",
    "7. Return all objects with (max-min) in a given band greater/smaller than k*rms. Motivation: another way to look for variables (using a different light curve statistic)\n",
    "8. Return all objects that were detected only m times (or only within T1 days), while their position was observed at least N times (m < N ),  or longer than T2 days (T1 < T2). Motivation: afterglows, microlensing, SNe"
